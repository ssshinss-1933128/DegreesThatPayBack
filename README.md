# DegreesThatPayBack
A project which takes data that links Undergraduate Majors to Salary amounts and ranks them through different criteria. Those criteria include income categories such as Starting Median Salary, Mid-Career Median Salary, 75th Percentile Salary, etc. Another criteria we use to rank the Majors is a point system that we've created in Python to generalize all the income categories mentioned before. This project's objective is aimed at students who find themselves struggling with the overwhelming number of major options. We'd like to explore the income factor in choosing a career path, and hopefully prevent students from looking at a singular figure while encouraging them to do some further research about what each major has to offer.

#  About Data
The main dataset that I'll be using is a dataset weâ€™ve found in kaggle. This data is perfect for us because it pretty much maps out all the categories of salaries that we need. This dataset is reliable because it is owned by the Wall Street Journal. As this website is extremely well known and serves millions of viewers online, I would like to say that this is an authoritative and legitimate dataset. The unedited original data set is linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kingabzpro/degrees-that-pay-you-back

# Miscellaneous Information
This project was done on Visual Studio Code, but it can run on any other source-code editor. If for some reason the data set doesn't get translated into the pandas dataframe correctly, I've included the data so that anyone can simply download it and put the path to that data into the read_csv function.
